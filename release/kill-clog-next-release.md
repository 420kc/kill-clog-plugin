## Release Notes

Kill Clog 2.3.2

* adds an optional leaderboard selector under Lookup, with Normal, Ironman, Hardcore, Ultimate, Skiller, and Pure icons below the grid
* changes ranks without changing detected account identity, levels, XP, KC, Collection Logs, or personal bests
* uses the selected leaderboard for both players in comparison; new primary lookups return to automatic selection
* clears unavailable ranks and labels loading, unavailable, or historical results on the selected icon's hover text
* reuses recent hiscores responses and fetches other leaderboard ranks on demand
* shows Unranked for missing entries on a loaded leaderboard, without treating loading or failed requests as unranked
* includes Abyssal protector in Runecraft's Pets section and adds Phoenix under Firemaking Pets; shared pets still count once toward each skill total
* lets long chat clogs wrap between items while keeping duplicate counts with their sprites
* expands !kclog [page] and !missing [page] to the full Collection Log catalog, including All Pets, Mastering Mixology, and Random Events
* shows pet duplicate quantities with !kclog pets; !3a and !gilded now show quantities too
* replaces loose substring matching with full page names and explicit shortcuts, fixing random events matching ven for Venenatis
* uses the panel's collection-log source selection for chat while keeping local self data authoritative
* documents command ownership and the complete page/shortcut chart; RuneLite commands and RuneProfile's !log handler remain intact
