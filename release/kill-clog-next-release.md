# Kill Clog Next Release

Target version: `2.3.2` (local candidate)

## Release Notes

Kill Clog 2.3.2

* adds an optional leaderboard selector under Lookup, with Normal, Ironman, Hardcore, Ultimate, Skiller, and Pure icons below the grid
* changes ranks without changing detected account identity, levels, XP, KC, Collection Logs, or personal bests
* uses the selected leaderboard for both players in comparison; new primary lookups return to automatic selection
* clears unavailable ranks and labels loading, unavailable, or historical results on the selected icon's hover text
* reuses recent hiscores responses and fetches other leaderboard ranks on demand
* shows Unranked for missing entries on a loaded leaderboard, without treating loading or failed requests as unranked

* lets long chat clogs wrap between items while keeping duplicate counts with their sprites
